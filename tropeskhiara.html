    <h2>Ideas</h2>
    <p>When I get an idea for a story, the first thing I do is rush to my Notes app on my phone just to jot dow the basic thoughts going through my head. Writing the jist of it down somewhere reinforces the thought in my head and gives me the oppurtunity to go back to it later and either delete it because it's terrible and belongs in the trash (most of my ideas), or expand upon it. Bring it to life. Ideas can come from just about anywhere, but it can vary btween different people. For example, I attain my ideas from:</p>
    <ol>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
