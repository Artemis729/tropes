    <h1>My Writing Process</h1>

    <h2>Ideas</h2>
    <p>When I get an idea for a story, the first thing I do is rush to my Notes app on my phone just to jot dow the basic thoughts going through my head. Writing the jist of it down somewhere reinforces the thought in my head and gives me the oppurtunity to go back to it later and either delete it because it's terrible and belongs in the trash (most of my ideas), or expand upon it. Bring it to life. Ideas can come from just about anywhere, but it can vary btween different people. For example, I attain my ideas from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Music</li>
        <li>Other Books</li>
        <li>Edits</li>
        <li>Shows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The important thing to know is that you should never copy another creator's material directly. if you get inspired, you can change things about that other creator's idea to make it your own. This is probably where my favorite thing ever came from: tropes.</p>
    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <p>Planning isn't definite step for all writers but it is for me. If i don't have a plan for the main parts of the book, in short, it will not get written. Ever. It will stay in the dark of my drafts as an untitles half-paragraph for eternity. which is kinda cool to think about but not the point. Some things that are very important in my planning process are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Layout</li>
        <li>Characters</li>
        <li>Basic Plot</li>
        <li>Start/Finish</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes planning really isn't necessary and more times than not I end up planning things and then changing them. But having it there is helpful and keeps me motivated. which is out next topic.</p>
    <h2>*emoji sparkles*Motivation*emoji sparkles*</h2>
    <p>Out of all the steps that come with the writing process, finding motivation is definitely the hardest. What do I do about it? If I'm being totally honest, nothing. Other times the writing motivation comes to me in a burst and if I don't let it explode in a burst of barely coherent words, I will die. It's part of the contract I signed against my will. Anywho I think that's all I need to say about that. if you find motivation, good for you. Can't relate. I think I just lost mtoivation talking about this.</p>
    <h2>Actually Writing</h2>
    <p>Writing is something that just comes naturally to me. I can't really explain how it happens, it just kinda works. I have the chapter in my head and as I'm writing, I sort of just work out how I get there. I almost always know how a chapter should end, so as long as I can figure out how to get there, I'll write. Typically, a write 2000-5000 words per chapter which results in 7 to 17 pages on Google Docs. I love writing because having a finished product is the most satisfying feeling in existence.</p>
    <h2>How to Deal With Writers Block</h2>
