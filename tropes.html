    <h1>My Better Writing Process</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <h2 class="ideahead">Ideas</h2>
    <p>I usually ascertain my ideas by combining ideas from things that interest me, like </p> 
    <ol>
    <li>movies and Tv</li>
    <li>Books</li>
    <li>Things I find while browsing the internet</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Throughout my viewing, I'll jot down any ideas I get in my notesapp and go to them when I'm looking for something to write.</p>
    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <p>My planning consists of talking about my story idea to anyone who will listen, thinking about it for a while, and only recently have I started doing story boards.
    Most of the time when I do plan, it happens while I'm writing the story, occasionally I'll stop and think about where I want the story to go or consult a friend if I don't know where to take the story.
    or I'll just drop the story because I stopped liking the idea I had. Planning is very necessary to keeping a clear and consice story, it helps to ensure that characters get the outcome that the author wants.
    Planning is also good for keeping motivation with your writing project. Speaking of motivation.
    </p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Now, getting the motivation to write, and writing more is the most difficult thing about writing. Living in a world with so many sources of immedient, effortless dopamine makes it difficult for anyone to focus on doing something that can take a long time to feel rewarding, Like writing.
        What I like to do is get someone to hold me accountable while I try to write. It's helped in the past and is very useful, assuming someone is there to help. When people aren't there, (Most of the time.)I try to remove all of the sources of dopamine, or at least make them inconvinient to ascertain.
        That also works and it's helped me write for long periods of time and it may help you, probably not though because I just realized the only people who will read this are Khiara and you, Mr. Dobbs.

    <h2>How to deal with writers block</h2>
    <p>Writers block? Why did you include this Khiara? This is a blatant skill issue in my opinion. You just need to cope</p>
