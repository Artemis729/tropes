    <h2>Ideas</h2>
    <p>I usually ascertain my ideas by combining ideas from things that interest me, like </p> 
    <ol>
    <li>movies and Tv</li>
    <li>Books</li>
    <li>Things I find while browsing the internet</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Throughout my viewing, I'll jot down any ideas I get in my notesapp and go to them when I'm looking for something to write.</p>
